<!-- List of counters the achievements can query.
     The format to use is <goal type="name_of_the_counter" value="X"/>
     where X is the desired value of the counter ;e.g. <won_races value="10"/>

     WARNING!  If a goal node is malformed, it is ignored.

    S - Logical relations and subgoals

        When you define multiple goals, the achievement will be completed
        if they are all met, but they don't need to be met at once.
        To have more possibilities, you can define subgoals and the
        logical relationship they need to meet.

        The available relations are :

        AND // The subgoals have to be met, but not necessarily at once
        AND-AT-ONCE // The subgoals have to be met at the same time.
        OR // One of the subgoal has to be met
        SUM // The subgoals sum must reach a certain (positive !) number.

        The format to use for AND, AND-AT-ONCE and OR is :
        <goal type="AND">
            <goal type="name_of_counter" value="X"/>
            <goal type="name_of_counter" value="Y"/>
        </goal>

        For SUM, it is :
        <goal type="SUM" value="X">
            <goal type="name_of_counter" operation="+"/>
            <goal type="name_of_counter" operation="-"/>
        </goal>
        With the value of operation (+ or -) defining if the subgoal is added
        or subtracted from the total.

        Sub-goals can also have their own sub-goals,
        however a AND, AND-AT-ONCE or OR can't have a SUM goal for parent.
    ___________________________________________________________________________

    I - Won races (normal, time-trial, FTL) counters.
        Require to beat at least 3 AIs in any difficulty.

        won-races : total number of races won
        won-normal-races
        won-tt-races
        won-ftl-races

    II - Consecutive won races counters.
        These counters are reset if a race is restarted,
        or if a race is lost even if the AI count to increment
        is not met.

        cons-won-races
        cons-won-races-hard // This requires 5+ AIs and expert+ difficulty

    III - Race started and finished counters, by difficulty (linear races only)
        easy-started
        easy-finished
        medium-started
        medium-finished
        hard-started
        hard-finished
        best-started
        best-finished

    IV - Race started and finished counters, by game mode.
        Races against a ghost are counted both in the base mode counter,
        either time-trial or egg hunt, and in their own specific counter.

        normal-started
        normal-finished
        tt-started
        tt-finished
        ftl-started
        ftl-finished
        three-strikes-started
        three-strikes-finished
        soccer-started
        soccer-finished
        egg-hunt-started
        egg-hunt-finished
        with-ghost-started
        with-ghost-finished
        ctf-started
        ctf-finished
        ffa-started
        ffa-finished
        
    IV - Counters related to powerup use. The hit counters reference how many
        times the player kart has hit other karts, not how often it was hit.

        powerup-used
        powerup-used-1race
        bowling-hit
        bowling-hit-1race
        swatter-hit
        swatter-hit-1race
        all-hits // hits from bowling ball, cake and swatter
        all-hits-1race
        hit-same-kart-1race

    V - Counters related to other race events.

        banana // counts how many banana the player's kart has hit
        banana-1race
        skidding
        skidding-1race
        skidding-1lap

    VI - Per-track counters (at least one track reach the value)

        race-started
        race-finished
        race-won
        race-finished-reverse
        race-finished-alone
        less-laps
        more-laps
        twice-laps
        egg-hunt-started
        egg-hunt-finished

    VII - Per-track counters (all non-addon tracks reach the value)

        race-started-all
        race-finished-all
        race-won-all
        race-finished-reverse-all
        race-finished-alone-all
        less-laps-all
        more-laps-all
        twice-laps-all

        // For egg hunts, all non-addon tracks with egg hunt support
        // must reach the value
        egg-hunt-started-all
        egg-hunt-finished-all
